"""Pipecat MCP Server for voice I/O.

This server exposes voice tools via the MCP protocol, enabling any MCP client
to have voice conversations with users through a Pipecat pipeline.

Tools:
    start: Initialize and start the voice agent.
    listen: Wait for user speech and return transcribed text.
    speak: Speak text to the user via text-to-speech.
    stop: Gracefully shut down the voice pipeline.
